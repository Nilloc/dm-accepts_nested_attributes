 * bumped version to 0.0.6.

[91923dd | Wed May 13 04:18:49 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * respect dm-is-remixable (thx Asher Van Brunt for pointing this out)

    Since class_inheritable_accessor is not available on Module, dana
    bailed out for dm-is-remixable. This should hopefully fix this issue.

[ef8e1ca | Mon May 11 00:17:43 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added CHANGELOG rake task and file (taken from manveru/ramaze)

 * bump tiny version for extlib/hook compatible gem.

[c34edae | Wed Apr 29 04:46:43 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * now compatible with extlib/hook. (last commit was missing files)

[8e42229 | Wed Apr 29 04:34:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * workaround extlib/hook not respecting hooked but redefined methods.

[578e658 | Wed Apr 29 02:46:56 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * only alter common DataMapper namespace if really necessary.

[7da8378 | Wed Apr 29 01:41:07 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * less brittle specs with no more auto_migrations before(:each)

[f2a2fcb | Wed Apr 29 01:38:00 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * updated Manifest and gemspec to reflect spec cleanings

[dd0a4a8 | Fri Apr 24 17:29:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed fixtures and specs for customized has(n, :through) associations.

    It makes no sense to spec all different options for the association
    macros in integration specs. Rather, it should be specced once and
    for all (in unit specs) that dm-accepts_nested_attributes infers the
    right kind of associations. Think about it, then do it!

[ac7c008 | Fri Apr 24 17:27:12 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * be explicit about before(:each)

[7a56d17 | Fri Apr 24 17:26:35 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed commented code

[03bc5c2 | Fri Apr 24 17:25:25 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * don't auto_migrate! before(:each) spec run (takes half the time)

[b6f5bf5 | Tue Apr 21 14:52:22 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed debugging outputs

[001c791 | Sat Apr 18 14:31:35 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * formatting

[3fceda3 | Sat Apr 18 02:34:54 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * no need to require gem dependencies in spec_helper.rb

[2118726 | Wed Apr 15 18:57:22 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initial support for wrapping every save inside a transaction.

    * this probably needs more thinking, also funny is that specs if
      called from textmate rspec bundle all pass, whereas when called
      from the shell, some of them (only has(1)) break.
      investigate this
    * dbussink also suggested it might be a good idea to add an option
      that allows to turn transaction usage off.
    * also, look for some api to infer wether a backend supports
      (nested) transactions or not. we could default to true if it does,
      but still leave the option to turn it off nevertheless.

[abdc211 | Wed Apr 15 14:18:07 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added sanitize_nested_attributes to provide a hook for doing this.

    * see http://is.gd/sz2d for the motivation behind this new method

[158b6ea | Wed Apr 15 02:50:38 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * fixed broken generated gemspec. find out why this happens.

[5603c57 | Wed Apr 15 02:49:54 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

[32dcfe8 | Wed Apr 15 02:20:00 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initial support for dm-validations

    * this desperately needs specs! currently only basic not null
      constraint specs pass (well, there are no other).
    * saving a resource along with its associations should always
      be done inside a transaction! figure out how to do that!
    * validation errors from associated resources should be copied
      to the parent resource. this currently happens, but it's not
      specced at all so consider the behavior undefined.

[fef1578 | Wed Apr 15 01:37:14 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initialize dm logger before setting up dm adapter

[8d7ede8 | Wed Apr 15 01:35:50 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

[b45ea52 | Fri Apr 10 16:12:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added get_#{association_name} helper for (many/one)_to_one associations.

    This is mainly to support common usecases in fields_for. This method
    will return a new record if the associated object is nil at the time
    it is accessed, and the associated object otherwise. This should help
    fields_for to render the right id and name attributes for the input
    fields. This method is not generated for (one/many)_to_many associations
    since these return an Collection anyway and this allow to call build
    or get on it. A possible use case would look something like this:
    
    <% fields_for @location.get_geo_point do %>
     ...
    <% end =%>
    
    The whole purpose of this commit is to provide something to fields_for
    that is guaranteed to not be nil.
