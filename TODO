TODO
====

* add specs for :reject_if => :foo option, but think about _where_ first!
* think about supporting :reject_unless in addition to :reject_if
* think about generalizing :reject_if to not only work for new? resources
* think about :allow_destroy accepting the same parameters like :reject_if
